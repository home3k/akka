/**
 * A Router that performs load balancing to cluster nodes based on
 * cluster metric data.
 *
 * It uses random selection of routees based probabilities derived from
 * the remaining capacity of corresponding node.
 *
 * Please note that providing both 'nrOfInstances' and 'routees' does not make logical
 * sense as this means that the router should both create new actors and use the 'routees'
 * actor(s). In this case the 'nrOfInstances' will be ignored and the 'routees' will be used.
 * <br>
 * <b>The</b> configuration parameter trumps the constructor arguments. This means that
 * if you provide either 'nrOfInstances' or 'routees' during instantiation they will
 * be ignored if the router is defined in the configuration file for the actor being used.
 *
 * <h1>Supervision Setup</h1>
 *
 * The router creates a “head” actor which supervises and/or monitors the
 * routees. Instances are created as children of this actor, hence the
 * children are not supervised by the parent of the router. Common choices are
 * to always escalate (meaning that fault handling is always applied to all
 * children simultaneously; this is the default) or use the parent’s strategy,
 * which will result in routed children being treated individually, but it is
 * possible as well to use Routers to give different supervisor strategies to
 * different groups of children.
 *
 * @param metricsSelector decides what probability to use for selecting a routee, based
 *   on remaining capacity as indicated by the node metrics
 * @param routees string representation of the actor paths of the routees that will be looked up
 *   using `actorFor` in [[akka.actor.ActorRefProvider]]
